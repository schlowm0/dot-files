### CiteBibtex 1.3.0 Changelog

Changes:

* Improved recognition of cite keys in both Markdown and LaTeX documents
* Added a separate command (bound to F9 by default) to insert a pre-formatted plaintext bibliography entry rather than a citation key. Configured via the new `citation_format_string` setting in the plugin settings, which is a Python format string, set to `"{author} ({year}). {title}"` by default. Any BibTeX field can be used in the format string, missing ones will be replaced with an empty string.
