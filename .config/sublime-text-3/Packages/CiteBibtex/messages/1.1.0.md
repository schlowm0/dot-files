### CiteBibtex 1.1.0 Changelog

If you are upgrading from 1.0.0, have a look at the default plugin settings file for an overview of changed and newly added configuration options.

Changes:

* Auto-detect citation style based on syntax (Markdown/Pandoc or LaTeX). This is enabled by default, but can be turned off in the plugin settings.
* Extract those citations used in the currently open file from the global BibTeX file and save them alongside the currently open file (e.g. if `paper.md` is open, they are saved in `paper.bib` in the same directory). __WARNING__: this will overwrite a possibly existing .bib file without asking. This feature is available via the command palette (`CiteBibTeX: Extract citations in current file`).
* Ability to customize available citation styles and syntax mappings in the plugin settings
* Now GPLv3 licensed.
