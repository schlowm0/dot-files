Preceding work has shown that soft winnertake-all (WTA) circuits, where pyramidal neurons inhibit each other via interneurons, are a common motif of corticalmicrocircuits. We show through theoretical analysis and computer simulations that Bayesian computation is induced inthese network motifs through STDP in combination with activity-dependent changes in the excitability of neurons. Thefundamental components of this emergent Bayesian computation are priors that result from adaptation of neuronalexcitability and implicit generative models for hidden causes that are created in the synaptic weights through STDP. In fact,a surprising result is that STDP is able to approximate a powerful principle for fitting such implicit generative models tohigh-dimensional spike inputs: Expectation Maximization. Our results suggest that the experimentally observedspontaneous activity and trial-to-trial variability of cortical neurons are essential features of their information processingcapability, since their functional role is to represent probability distributions rather than static neural codes.
